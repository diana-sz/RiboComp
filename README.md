# Ribosome composition

Scripts to study the effect of ribosome composition on growth rate using resource balance analysis (RBA) and elementary growth vectors


## code/

### Simulations
* general.py - models, functions and classes used by other scripts 
* run_all_conditions.py - RBA simulations that find max. growth rate at each ribosome composition
* fluxes_vs_growth_rate.py - vary growth rate at fixed xrP = 36%; save RNAP fluxes
                              with or without accumulation of R or rRNA
* kostinski_reproduction.py - RBA with fixed allocation of R and RNAP
                               parameters from Kostinski & Reuveni 2020
* fit_kdegmax.py - fit R degradation rate so that the optimal composition is xrP=36%

### Plots 
* plot_xrp_vs_mu.R - plot growth rate vs. ribosome composition
* plot_allocation.R - plot ribosome allocation vs. ribosome composition
* plot_RNAP_fluxes.R - plot RNAP fluxes vs. growth rate at fixed xrP=36%
* plot_RP_ratio.R - plot RNA:protein ratio at different growth rates
* plot_vdeg_ratio.R - plot ratio of RNA degradation flux to RNAP flux
