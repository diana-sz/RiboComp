# Ribosome composition

Scripts to study the effect of ribosome composition on growth rate using resource balance analysis (RBA) and elementary growth vectors


## code/

### Simulations
* general.py -- models, functions and classes used by other scripts, 
* rba.py -- standard RBA with E.coli parameters / parameters that make RNA more expensive than protein
* fit_rnapmax.py -- find optimal rnapmax such that the maximum growth rate is reached with xrP=36%
* rnapmax.py -- RBA with a limit on total RNA polymerase (RNAP)
                for E. coli in different media and archaea
* fluxes_rnapmax.py -- RBA with a limit on total RNAP; fixed xrP = 36%; saves RNAP fluxes
                          with or without accumulation of R or rRNA
                          with or without limits on the maximum R and RNAP activity
* init_rate.py -- RBA with a limit on RNAP initiation rate (instead of standard RNAP capacity constraint)
* kostinski_reproduction.py -- RBA with fixed allocation of R and RNAP
                               parameters from Kostinski & Reuveni 2020
* analytical_xrP.py -- calculate optimal xrP (protein fraction in ribosome) analytically
                       for a range of different transcription and translation rates
* rrna_deg.py -- RBA with ribosome degradation reaction. The degradation rate decreases 
                 with xrP
* fit_kdegmax.py -- fit R degradation rate so that the optimal composition is xrP=36%
* fluxes_rrna_deg.py -- calculate RNAP fluxes at xrP=36% at different growth rates

### Plots 
* plot_xrp_vs_mu.R -- plot growth rate vs. ribosome composition
* plot_allocation.R -- plot ribosome allocation vs. ribosome composition
* plot_RNAP_fluxes.R -- plot RNAP fluxes vs. growth rate at fixed xrP=36%
* plot_mass_fraction.R -- plot RNA:protein ratio at different growth rates
* plot analytical_xrp.R -- plot optiaml xrp calculated analytically for different 
                           trancription/translation rates
                           (output of analytical_xrp.py)
