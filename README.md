# Ribosome composition

Scripts to study the effect of ribosome composition on growth rate using Elementary growth modes / vectors (EGMs/EGVs)


## code/

### Simulations
* general_functions.py -- various functions used by other scripts
* RBA.py -- standard RBA with E.coli parameters / parameters that make RNA more expensive than protein
* fit_RNAPmax.py -- find optimal RNAPmax such that the maximum growth rate is reached with xrP=36%
* RNAPmax.py -- RBA with a limit on total RNA polymerase (RNAP) without / with
                limits on the maximum Ribosome (R) and RNAP activity
                for E. coli and archaeal parameters (only without activities)
* fluxes_RNAPmax.py -- RBA with a limit on total RNAP; fixed xR = 36%; saves RNAP fluxes
                          with or without accumulation of R or rRNA
                          with or without limits on the maximum R and RNAP activity
* init_rate.py -- RBA with a limit on RNAP initiation rate (instead of standard RNAP capacity constraint)
* PRL_reproduction.py -- RBA with fixed allocation of R and RNAP and maximum activities, 
                         parameters from Kostinski & Reuveni 2020
* analytical_xrP.py -- calculate optimal xrP (protein fraction in ribosome) analytically
                       for a range of different transcription and translation rates

### Plots 
* plot_xR_vs_mu.R -- plot growth rate vs. ribosome composition  
                    (outputs of RBA.py, RNAPmax.py, init_rate.py)
* plot_allocation.R -- plot ribosome allocation vs. ribosome composition
                       (outputs of RBA.py, RNAPmax.py)
* plot_RNAP_fluxes.R -- plot RNAP fluxes vs. growth rate at fixed xrP=36%
                        (output of fluxes_RNAPmax.py)
* plot_PRL.py -- plot growth rate vs. ribosome composition (Kostinski & Reuveni 2020 reproduction)
                 (output of PRL_reproduction.py)
* plot analytical_xrp.R -- plot optiaml xrp calculated analytically for different 
                           trancription/translation rates
                           (output of analytical_xrp.py)
