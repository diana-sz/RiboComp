# Ribosome composition

Scripts to study the effect of ribosome composition on growth rate using resource balance analysis (RBA) and elementary growth vectors (EGVs).


## code/

### Simulations
* general.py - models, functions and classes used by other scripts 
* run_all_conditions.py - RBA simulations that find max. growth rate at each ribosome composition
                          for different parameter sets (specified in parameters_v2.csv)
* fluxes_vs_growth_rate.py - vary growth rate at fixed xrP = 36%; save RNAP fluxes
                             with or without excess accumulation of R or rRNA / excess RNA degradation
* kostinski_reproduction.py - RBA with fixed allocation of R and RNAP
                              parameters from Kostinski & Reuveni 2020
* fit_kdegmax.py - fit R degradation rate so that the optimal composition is xrP=36%

### Plots 
* plot_growth_rates.R - plot growth rate vs. ribosome composition
* plot_allocations.R - plot ribosome allocation vs. ribosome composition
* plot_RNAP_fluxes.R - plot RNAP fluxes vs. growth rate at fixed xrP=36%
* plot_RP_ratios.R - plot RNA:protein ratios at different growth rates
* plot_RNase_RNAP_ratios.R - plot ratios of RNA degradation flux to RNAP flux at max. growth rates


## data/
* outputs of the simulations
    * RBA_[xy].csv - outputs of run_all_conditions.py (growth rates, fluxes, 
      ribosome allocations and metabolite mass fractions)
    * fluxes_x0.36.csv - output of fluxes_vs_growth_rate.py
    * Kostinski_reproduction_growth_rates.csv - output of kostinski_reproduction.py
* parameters_v2.csv - parameters for simulations in run_all_conditions.py; columns
    * matrix_type - 
        * base - matrix without RNA degradation
        * extended - matrix with RNA degradation by RNase
        * extended_mito - same as extended but some rPs are imported for free
    * kdeg_max - maximum degradation rate, values from 'fit_kdegmax.py' or doubled for archaea
    * medium - 1,3: glycerol; 2,4,5: glucose; 0: succinate
    * parameter_set - combinations of following strings:
        * activities - R and RNAP activities included; 
        * activities2 - R and RNAP activities, and RNAP allocations included
        * archaea - archaeal parameters
        * rna_expensive - parameters artificially changed to make RNA more expensive than proteins
        * hill-[n] - RNA degradation rate calculated with hill function (n = hill factor)
* gausing_RNA_deg.csv - fraction of degraded RNA at different growth rates from Gausing 1977 
                        extracted with WebPlotDigitizer
* fluxes_bremer.csv - fluxes from Bremer 1996, converted to mmol/gh with fluxes_vs_growth_rate.py
* stats.csv - optimal xrP for each condition & growth rate at xrP = 36%, output of plot_growth_rates.R
